ok first download - at top you see green button 'clone or download'

ok then install node on your thing

then open terminal and run `sudo npm install http-server -g` and hope it works

then navigate into this folder here 

then run `npm build` and if it nowork then `npm run build`

then you should see a new folder created in project root, called `/dist`

then run `http-server ./dist/`
